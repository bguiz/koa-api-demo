# `koa-api-demo`

## Steps

- [x] Initialise -
  [tag](https://github.com/bguiz/koa-api-demo/tree/v0.0.1)
  - Create `package.json` using `npm init`
  - `npm install --save` dependencies needed by the server
  - `npm install --save-dev` dependencies used in development and testing
  - Create `npm run *` scripts:
    - `start` to run the server
    - `lint` to verify syntax
    - `test` to do tests
    - `cover` to do code coverage
    - The are all done pre-emptively, not used yet,
      since we have written neither the application code nor test cases
- [x] Test -

  - Create `lib/server.js`
    - Use `koa` to run a HTTP server
    - However
  - Create `test/00-hello.spec.js`
    - `describe()` and `it()` from `mocha` to group and define test cases
    - use `co()` to enable running tests using `yield`
      - Ensure that done is always called by using this pattern:
        `co(function *() { /* ... */ }).then(done, done);`
    - Tests do not actually need to run over HTTP,
      simply interact with the `koa` instance directly
      (just like in `express`)
    - Use `supertest-as-promised` for *promisified*,
      and therefore *`yield`-able* in tests
    - Run `npm run test`
      - Executes `packageJson.scripts.test`
        - `node --harmony ./node_modules/mocha/bin/_mocha -u bdd -R spec`
      - Tests will fail, of course, because we have not written
        any code on the server for this endpoint!
          - Output:
            ```bash
              Error: expected { hello: 'world!' } response body, got {}
              + expected - actual

              -{}
              +{
              +  "hello": "world!"
              +}
            ```
      - We are writing tests first, and then doing the implementation next
- [x] Server -

  - Update `lib/server.js`
    - Use `koa-router` to define routes at `/api/v1/hello`
    - Define a generator function for `koa` to serve a HTTP `GET` at this URL
    - Response is a simple hard coded JSON object, and sets the status to `200` (OK)
    - Visit `http://localhost:4200/api/v1/hello` to see the response in your browser
  - Execute `npm run test`, and this time the test that was failing earlier starts to pass
  - Congratulations, we now have a HTTP server!
    - that serves JSON responses
    - uses generator functions
- [x] Lint -
  [tag](https://github.com/bguiz/koa-api-demo/tree/v0.0.4)

  - Run `eslint` from the command line using `npm run lint`
    - Executes `packageJson.scripts.lint`
      - `./node_modules/.bin/eslint lib`
      - Uses configuration in `.eslintrc`
        - Take a look at this files contents
        - Configure it to your liking
          - [How to configure `eslint`](http://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/configuring.html)
          - [The available `eslint` rules](http://eslint.org/docs/rules/)
      - The lint task should exit with no errors
    - Edit `lib/server.js` and remove a semicolon at random
      - Run the lint task again, notice that a test failure occurs:
        ```bash
          lib/server.js
            4:19  error  Missing semicolon  semi

          âœ– 1 problem (1 error, 0 warnings)
        ```
      - Undo the edit, replacing the lost semicolon
      - Run the lint task yet again, and we are back to no errors
  - Be sure to run the lint task every now and then on your code
    - Ensures that your code style is consistent
      across different parts of your code
    - This is doubly important across any project that is
      large, complex, or involves more than one developer
    - A good way to nip nasty bugs in the bud
      (i.e. before they even become bugs)
