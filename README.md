# `koa-api-demo`

## Steps

- [x] Initialise -
  [tag](https://github.com/bguiz/koa-api-demo/tree/v0.0.1)
  - Create `package.json` using `npm init`
  - `npm install --save` dependencies needed by the server
  - `npm install --save-dev` dependencies used in development and testing
  - Create `npm run *` scripts:
    - `start` to run the server
    - `lint` to verify syntax
    - `test` to do tests
    - `cover` to do code coverage
    - The are all done pre-emptively, not used yet,
      since we have written neither the application code nor test cases
- [x] Test -

  - Create `lib/server.js`
    - Use `koa` to run a HTTP server
    - However
  - Create `test/00-hello.spec.js`
    - `describe()` and `it()` from `mocha` to group and define test cases
    - use `co()` to enable running tests using `yield`
      - Ensure that done is always called by using this pattern:
        `co(function *() { /* ... */ }).then(done, done);`
    - Tests do not actually need to run over HTTP,
      simply interact with the `koa` instance directly
      (just like in `express`)
    - Use `supertest-as-promised` for *promisified*,
      and therefore *`yield`-able* in tests
    - Run `npm run test`
      - Executes `packageJson.scripts.test`
        - `node --harmony ./node_modules/mocha/bin/_mocha -u bdd -R spec`
      - Tests will fail, of course, because we have not written
        any code on the server for this endpoint!
          - Output:
            ```bash
              Error: expected { hello: 'world!' } response body, got {}
              + expected - actual

              -{}
              +{
              +  "hello": "world!"
              +}
            ```
      - We are writing tests first, and then doing the implementation next
- [x] Server -
  [tag](https://github.com/bguiz/koa-api-demo/tree/v0.0.3)
  [diff](https://github.com/bguiz/koa-api-demo/compare/v0.0.2...v0.0.3)
  - Update `lib/server.js`
    - Use `koa-router` to define routes at `/api/v1/hello`
    - Define a generator function for `koa` to serve a HTTP `GET` at this URL
    - Response is a simple hard coded JSON object, and sets the status to `200` (OK)
    - Visit `http://localhost:4200/api/v1/hello` to see the response in your browser
  - Execute `npm run test`, and this time the test that was failing earlier starts to pass
  - Congratulations, we now have a HTTP server!
    - that serves JSON responses
    - uses generator functions
- [x] Lint -
  [tag](https://github.com/bguiz/koa-api-demo/tree/v0.0.4)
  [diff](https://github.com/bguiz/koa-api-demo/compare/v0.0.3...v0.0.4)
  - Run `eslint` from the command line using `npm run lint`
    - Executes `packageJson.scripts.lint`
      - `./node_modules/.bin/eslint lib`
      - Uses configuration in `.eslintrc`
        - Take a look at this files contents
        - Configure it to your liking
          - [How to configure `eslint`](http://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/configuring.html)
          - [The available `eslint` rules](http://eslint.org/docs/rules/)
      - The lint task should exit with no errors
    - Edit `lib/server.js` and remove a semicolon at random
      - Run the lint task again, notice that a test failure occurs:
        ```bash
          lib/server.js
            4:19  error  Missing semicolon  semi

          âœ– 1 problem (1 error, 0 warnings)
        ```
      - Undo the edit, replacing the lost semicolon
      - Run the lint task yet again, and we are back to no errors
  - Be sure to run the `lint` task every now and then on your code
    - Ensures that your code style is consistent
      across different parts of your code
    - This is doubly important across any project that is
      large, complex, or involves more than one developer
    - A good way to nip nasty bugs in the bud
      (i.e. before they even become bugs)
- [x] Cover -
  [tag](https://github.com/bguiz/koa-api-demo/tree/v0.0.5)
  [diff](https://github.com/bguiz/koa-api-demo/compare/v0.0.4...v0.0.5)
  - Run `istanbul` from the command line using `npm run cover`
    - Executes `packageJson.scripts.lint`
      - `./node_modules/.bin/babel-node ./node_modules/.bin/isparta cover ./node_modules/mocha/bin/_mocha`
    - `istanbul` on its own will not work,
      because it does not understand ES6 syntax;
      this is where `babel` and `isparta` come into play
    - View the code coverage report
      - There will be an overview report output to the terminal:
          ```bash
          =============================== Coverage summary ===============================
          Statements   : 100% ( 18/18 )
          Branches     : 100% ( 3/3 )
          Functions    : 100% ( 2/2 )
          Lines        : 100% ( 14/14 )
          ================================================================================
          ```
      - There will also be a JSON and LCOV reports,
        which is useful to export to external tools,
        such as a continuous integration/ deployment tool
        - `less coverage/coverage.json`
        - `less coverage/lcov.info `
      - There will also be a HTML report, which is useful for you to look at in detail
        - `firefox firefox coverage/lcov-report/index.html`
        - `firefox coverage/lcov-report/lib/server.js.html`
  - Code coverage essentially works by doing three things in sequence
    1. **Instrument** the code
      (place little markers in every line of code, statement, function, and branch)
    2. **Execute tests** using the test runner, in this case `mocha`
      (same one we have used in `npm run test`)
    3. **Build the report** as the tests execute,
      the little markers placed in the code during instrumentation
      track which bit have of code have been executed (and how often).
      From this, the code coverage tool can deduce
      which parts **have**, and have **not** been executed,
      and a report is created
  - Reduce the code coverage (intentionally) to see it action
    - Edit `lib/server.js`
      - Insert some redundant code into `getHelloWorld()`:
          ```javascript
          if (false) {
            (function() {
              console.log('This statement never gets reached');
            })();
          }
          ```
      - Now run the `cover` task again, and observe that our
        all-round 100 percent code coverage drop drop to 80-ish percent:
          ```bash
          =============================== Coverage summary ===============================
          Statements   : 90.48% ( 19/21 )
          Branches     : 80% ( 4/5 )
          Functions    : 66.67% ( 2/3 )
          Lines        : 88.24% ( 15/17 )
          ================================================================================
          ```
      - Undo the edit to `lib/server.js` to remove the redundant code,
        and run the `cover` task again;
        and observe that we restore our code coverage to an all-round 100 percent again.
  - Be sure to run the `cover` task every now and then on your code
    - Ensures two things:
      1. That the code that you have written is indeed being executed
        - Code that is not executed at all is dead code,
          and is an indicator of problems in your code base;
        - Usually it either needs to be deleted,
          or there is a bug somewhere else in the code
          where it is supposed to be getting called from
      1. That the tests that you have written do indeed test all of your code
        - Coverage is both about code coverage and test coverage
        - If some code is not getting execute,
          it could be simply because that there is not test case that reaches
          that particular statement, branch, or function
        - Usually this means that you need to think of additional test cases
          in order to more thoroughly test your code
    - Aim for a code coverage of as close to 100 percent as is reasonably possible
      (as projects get larger, and more complex, 100 percent is extremely hard to achieve)

  - Use `yuidocjs` to generate documentation
  - Install packages: `npm install --save-dev yuidocjs yuidoc-lucid-theme`
  - Create a config file `yuidoc.json`
    - Tells it to output to a folder named `docuemntation/`
    - Also tells it to ignore certain folders when generating documentation (e.g. `node_modules`)
  - Edit `lib/server.js` to add documentation comments
  - Run the document task:
    `npm run document`
  - Open generated documentation in your browser
    `firefox documentation/index.html`

  - [x] Command line
    - Open your terminal, get comfortable with issuing commands on it
    - You will need to be comfortable with issuing `npm` and `git` commands in the terminal
    - For `npm`, you will be using `npm run ___` commands quite a bit
      - Apart from this, you may occasionally use `npm link` and `npm publish`
      - Also, get familiar with the structure of a `package.json` file
    - With `git`, there is a lot more surface area to familiarise yourself with
      - Regular `git` commands such as `git clone`, `git checkout`, `git branch`, `git tag`, and `git merge`
      - `git flow` commands (optional) - which are mostly useful to have when
        your project becomes more complicated,
        or when there are multiple developers who are collaborating
  - [x] NodeJs, npm, nvm
    - NodeJs allows you to run Javascript without a browser
      - Most commonly used to write web servers (what we will be doing here),
        and also to write tools to aid with both front-end and back-end development
        (we have already used several of them so far)
    - `npm` is a package repository for NodeJs
      - Its primary purpose is to install and manage dependencies of your project
      - It also does a few other neat things as well,
        such as allowing you to define several build scripts
    - `nvm` is a tool to help you manage multiple versions of NodeJs and `npm`
      - It is the easiest way to install NodeJs and `npm`
        without falling into the `sudo` trap
      - It allows allows you to install multiple versions of the above,
        and switch between them seamlessly.
  - [x] Sublime text
    - No nonsense text editor
    - When you type, there is no perceptible lag before characters appear on the screen
    - `Ctrl+P` to jump to any file
    - `Ctrl+Click` on multiple locations to use multiple cursors
    - Rich plug-in ecosystem -
      you can get one for just about anything that you really need,
      and more importantly, you can get rid of anything you you do not really need
  - [x] HTTP anatomy
    - Request + response pairs
      - Send a request
        - Verb
        - Path
        - Headers
        - Body
      - Receive a response
        - Status code
        - Headers
        - Body
    - Layered on top of TCP/IP
      - A lower level networking protocol
      - Used to ensure that packets and sent and received in order,
        and that their transmission is lossless
    - Stateless
      - "State" is only held until the response is sent
      - Request + response is a single transaction, nothing is held after that
      - Keeping track of things for longer: cookies & tokens
    - HTTP/2 is coming soon
      - already in most browsers, but has not yet achieved widespread adoption
      - Different from HTTP/1 in several fundamental ways
      - We will be focussing on HTTP/1 for this course

  - We started off head first, demonstrating:
    - Setting up a NodeJs project
    - Installed dependencies for the NodeJs project
    - Used a generator function as a Koa middleware
      (but have not made use of yield yet)
    - Wrote and run integration tests using `supertest` and `mocha`
    - Wrote and run code coverage using `istanbul`, `isparta`, and `babel`
    - Wrote documentation in-line with ourcode,
      and used `yuidocjs` to generate a documentation website
  - After that, we took a step back
    - Familiarised ourselves with the command line interfaces,
      with a focus on those of `npm` and `git`
    - Learnt about how NodeJs, `npm`, and `nvm` are used
    - Familiarised ourselves with Sublime Text as a text editor
    - Brushed up on the relevant bits of HTTP that are important to keep in mind
- [x] Asynchronous Code: Callbacks -
  [tag](https://github.com/bguiz/koa-api-demo/tree/v0.0.9)
  [diff](https://github.com/bguiz/koa-api-demo/compare/v0.0.8...v0.0.9)
  - While waiting for something to happen,
    we should let the computer do other things in the mean time
    - For example, when waiting for a file to be written to disk,
      a program can simply ask to be notified when the disk I/O operations have completed,
      and resume execution when this happen.
  - The most basic way in which this is accomplished in Javascript is the
    **callback function**
  - Functions are first class objects in Javascript,
    meaning that they can be passed around just any other object
  - When you call function A, which needs to do something asynchronously,
    you can have it take function B as one if its parameters,
    and call function B when the code needs to continue
  - An informal standard for these callbacks functions has emerged,
    sometimes known as "errback" or "error-first callback",
    where the first parameter of the callback function is `err` (the error),
    and the second and subsequent parameters are whatever values
    that are "returned" by initiating function
    - This standard got popularised most notably in the APIs of the core NodeJs APIs
  - Further reading - if you wish to explore the topic of callbacks,
    and asynchronous Javascript in greater detail,
    you must first understand the Javascript event loop
    - This will delve into some implementation detail of the underlying
      engine that interprets and executes Javascript,
      (for NodeJs this would be V8, and the major browsers each have their own)
      and in particular, its event loop.
    - Here are some resources to deepen your knowledge in this area -
      not required to continue with this course
    - [Loupe](http://latentflip.com/loupe) -
      a visualisation to help you understand how Javascript's
      call stack/event loop/callback queue interact with each other.
    - [Understanding the Node.js Event Loop](https://nodesource.com/blog/understanding-the-nodejs-event-loop) - Trevor Norris
  - Run the demo: `node demos/async-callbacks.js`
    - Note that functions are hoisted,
      which is why they can be used seemingly before they are declared
    - Notice how the result (or error) is only printed **after** a while.
    - This is not possible if the function was synchronous,
      without completely hogging the CPU.
    - Note that the callback function, `asyncUsingCallbackFunction`, itself
      makes use of an in-built asynchronous callback function, `setTimeout`.
- [x] Asynchronous Code: Promises -
  [tag](https://github.com/bguiz/koa-api-demo/tree/v0.0.10)
  [diff](https://github.com/bguiz/koa-api-demo/compare/v0.0.9...v0.0.10)
  - While it is possible to write virtually any sort of asynchronous code
    using just callbacks, it is not necessarily going to be a pleasant experience.
    - In a not-too-uncommon scenario where there are several asynchronous functions
      which need to run consecutively,
      you wind up with an anti-pattern known as "callback hell" or "pyramid of doom"
      where there are callback functions nested within callback functions,
      which are themselves nested within yet more callback functions
    - Beyond a certain number of levels,
      the tedium of keeping track of the different paths becomes too great,
      and code quality begins to suffer
    - To compound this problem further, consider the difficulty introduced
      when handling errors within a deeply nested callback function
  - Promises emerged as a means to solve this problem
    - Allows you to write a sequence of asynchronous operations by chaining
      methods that return promises using `.then(nextAsyncFunction)`
    - Allows you to handle errors that occur anywhere in the chain of
      asynchronous operations using `.catch(errorHandlerFunction)`
    - These combined made it far easier to write asynchronous code
  - If using ES6, you have promises available natively;
    however with ES5, you can take your pick from one of many Promise libraries
  - Further reading:
    - [MDN: Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise)
  - Demo time:
    - In order to run the demo, we will be making use of promises,
      which are available natively in ECMAScript 6.
      To enable this, we will need to use a newer version of NodeJs,
      if you are not doing so already:
      ```bash
      nvm install iojs-3
      nvm use iojs-3
      ```
    - Now you can run the demo: `node demos/async-promises.js`
      - If you get an error similar to: `ReferenceError: Promise is not defined`,
        double check that you have installed the required version of NodeJs properly
    - In this demo, we have "chained" three functions that return a promise together,
      such that each one of them returns a promise,
      and its output is fed into the next function
    - The callbacks demo has also been updated: `node demos/async-callbacks.js`
    - Instead of just one callback, we now have three
      - The invocation of the functions that use callbacks are nested within each other.
        This is the "pyramid of doom" or "callback hell" that was mentioned earlier.
      - We can see how this gets hairy so fast in such a simple and contrived example,
        so imagine how bad it can get in a real world application
        that is going to be inherently much more complex.
      - The syntax for chaining promises is far more conducive for a developer
        to reason about his/ her code,
        than the syntax for nesting callbacks
      - Furthermore, notice how the code that handles errors needs to be repeated
        in the nested callbacks version,
        but only needs to occur once in the chained promises version.
    - As an exercise, create `fourthAsyncUsingCallbackFunction()` in the callbacks demo,
      and `fourthAsyncUsingPromise()` in the promises demo,
      and see which syntax you prefer to work with.
- [x] Asynchronous Code: Generators & yield -
  [tag](https://github.com/bguiz/koa-api-demo/tree/v0.0.11)
  [diff](https://github.com/bguiz/koa-api-demo/compare/v0.0.10...v0.0.11)
  - Promises are great, and they are an elegant upgrade from callbacks
  - However, generator functions and the `yield` keyword can be used together
    as syntactic sugar to make writing asynchronous code run synchronously
  - Using the latest NodeJs, generator functions and the `yield` keyword are
    available out of the box.
  - However, we need the help of a library to call the generator function
    in such a way that we can use it for asynchronous purposes.
    (More on this later, when we discuss `async` and `await` coming in ES7)
  - We use the `co` library for this purpose
    - We need to use `co` to wrap the generator function within
    - We then `yield` regular functions which must return `yield`-able
      objects, and using `co`, these can be either promises or thunks.
      We shall take a look at both of these in the next section.
  - This is very important to remember for the remainder of this course,
    as `koa` makes extensive use of generator functions and the `yield` keyword
  - Demo time
    - Run the demo: `node demos/async-generators.js`
    - In this demo we have syntax where we write a series of **asynchronous** code
      in a manner such that it looks even more like writing **synchronous** code
    - Being able to write code in this manner is one of the key motivations
      for using them, and for using frameworks like `koa`
    - Note that the functions continue to return promises,
      as promises are `yield`-able
    - If you have an existing code back that makes use of promises,
      switching to this style is going to be relatively easy to refactor for.
- [x] Asynchronous Code: Thunkify & promisify -
  [tag](https://github.com/bguiz/koa-api-demo/tree/v0.0.12)
  [diff](https://github.com/bguiz/koa-api-demo/compare/v0.0.11...v0.0.12)
  - The basic unit of asynchronous code in Javascript are callback functions
  - Building upon callback function, we have promises
  - Building upon promises, we have the use of the `yield` keyword
    (within generator functions)
  - Building upon promises as well, we will soon have the use of the `await` keyword
    (within `async` functions)
  - However, ES6 has barely been around for any time at all,
    and ES7 is not out yet,
    so most libraries out there will be built around callbacks
  - Some libraries are only beginning to move to promises now
  - So one of the challenges will be to wrap every callback function
    that we need to call in such a manner that it can be `yield`-ed
  - We could do this by hand - but that would be too tedious
  - Thankfully, there are libraries that do this automatically for us -
    several Promise libraries have "promisify" functions
    that turn "errback" functions into promises,
    and `thunkify` which turns "errback" functions into "thunks",
    which are also `yield`-able
  - Demo time
    - Install promisify and thunkify libraries: `npm install --save es6-promisify thunkify`
    - Run `node demos/async-thunkify-promisify.js`
    - We have three async functions implemented using callbacks
      which are, in fact, identical to the ones used in `demos/async-callbacks.js`
    - But we are invoking them from within a generator function wrapped using `co`,
      wrapping them with either `thunkify` or `promisify` (it doesn't matter which),
      and then `yield`-ing them
    - That's a pretty easy and neat way to wrap up functions in any existing
      libraries that make use of callbacks functions
    - Recall earlier in our Hello World example server,
      when writing the tests, we used a library called `supertest-as-promised`?
    - Well this is really a library called `supertest` which makes use of callbacks,
      wrapped using a technique similar to the ones that we have just done earlier,
      such that it makes use of promises instead;
      and therefore makes it `yield`-able
- [x] Asynchronous Code: Async & await -
  [tag](https://github.com/bguiz/koa-api-demo/tree/v0.0.13)
  [diff](https://github.com/bguiz/koa-api-demo/compare/v0.0.12...v0.0.13)
  - (but not going to use this)
  - The original intent of generator functions and the `yield` keyword
    was to enable lazy iterators and sequences,
    which are very handy in functional programming,
    and were a limiting factor in Javascript
    - So using these to write asynchronous code is a hack that works well for now
  - The `async` and `await` keywords are the *proper* way to do
    asynchronous stuff, but write them synchronously
      - When using generator functions nd the `yield` keyword,
        we had to wrap the generator functions using the `co` library,
        and we no longer need any sort of wrapper.
      - Note that in `koa` we use generator functions without any wrappers.
        This is because `koa` wraps functions passed into it using `co` under the hood.
  - If using ES7, you have `async` and `await` natively;
    however with ES6 and ES5, you can use `babel` to enable them
  - As of the time of writing this,
    the ES6 specifications have only just been finalised,
    and ES7 specifications are still very much changing;
    so here we will be using generator functions and the `yield` keyword
  - Demo time
    - ES7 is not here yet, but we can run `async` functions now thanks to `babel-node`
    - Run `./node_modules/.bin/babel-node demos/async-await.js`
    - We can still `promisify` errback functions,
      however, we can no longer `thunkify`:
      `await` only works on promises.
    - Apart from no longer needing a `co` wrapper,
      there is not much of a difference between the generator function form
      and the `async` function form.
    - The `async` function form is the most straight forward syntax amongst the
      four forms for asynchronous functions that we have seen so far:
      callbacks --> promises --> generator + `yield` --> `async` + `await`
    - We will be using the generator + `yield` form.

  - We have review the four different ways in which we can code
    Javascript asynchronously
  - Because Javascript is single threaded, knowing how to write asynchronous code
    is crucial
  - Starting with callback functions,
    available from the very first ever Javascript,
    we then looked at promises,
    then at generator functions plus `yield`,
    and then finally at `async` functions plus `await.
  - We have seen how it has gotten progressively easier
    to write asynchronous code.
    In essence, now we can write asynchronous code
    using syntax that looks like you are writing synchronous code.
  - This makes it so much easier to write,
    reason about,
  - It also makes it especially much easier to do error handling properly.
  - The future of asynchronous Javascript is bright!

  - REST is a software architecture style which guides us in how we design our APIs
  - The term was coined by Roy Fielding in an academic thesis
  - It has become a popular standard, and it is one whose principle we are going to follow
  - In summary, it stipulates that APIs should be:
    - Organised into resources
    - The different operations on the APIs should be accomplished
      using different HTTP verbs
    - Each API should make known other resources that are related to it
  - Resources

  - REST is a great thing to have, but it lacks a concrete implementation
  - Remember that REST originated in an academic paper
  - At the time in which REST was coined, and became popular,
    XML was the de-facto data exchange format on the web;
    whereas right now it is JSON
  - JSON API is merely a **concrete specification** of a RESTful API
    that uses JSON as its data exchange format
  - It also adds several features that are not part of the REST specification
    but complement it rather nicely,
    such as the ability to side-load resources
  - Also noteworthy, is that it has been registered with IANA,
    a standards body, and the specification has reach version 1.0

  - MongoDb is a document database
    - Its query syntax is very easy to pick up for Javascript developers
  - `monk` is a wrapper around MongoDb
    - It is a very minimal wrapper
    - The main reason that we use it is that we want to be able to
      `yield` database queries within generator functions.
      Using another library, `co-monk`, we get precisely this
